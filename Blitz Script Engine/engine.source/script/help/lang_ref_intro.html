  <p> BlitzScript3D is a case insensitive, type-less Scripting Language based 
    on BlitzBasic3D syntax with a few differences. It offers basic programming 
    language features, providing a interface to manipulate the core engine rendering, 
    audio, physics, AI, and I/O systems, and allows the creation and deletion 
    of objects, and definition of new functions.<br>
