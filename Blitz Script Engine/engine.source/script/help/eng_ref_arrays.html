<blockquote> 
  <p>An array is an ordered collection of variables of the same type, indexed 
    by an integer which counts from zero. The information needed consists of:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> 1) The data type of the elements. All elements have<br>
      the same data type, so it's natural to attribute<br>
      the same data type to the array itself. In other<br>
      words there is one data type per array, and it <br>
      applies to all elements.<br>
      2) Number of dimensions <br>
      3) The start-index and end-index of each dimension.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The internal structure of arrays is imposed by the compiler consistently 
    interpreting the storage area as a sequence of specific elements. The interpretation 
    is done by code the compiler inserts in the program, the code implements a 
    formula that translates array indices to memory addresses. For example, a 
    formula for a one-dimensional array may be similar to:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Memory-address = <br>
      Base-address + Element-size * (Array-index - Start-index)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
