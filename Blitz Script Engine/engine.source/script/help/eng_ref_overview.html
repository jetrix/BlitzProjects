<blockquote> 
  <p> BlitzScript3D Engine is a portable scripting system that can be added to 
    practically any Blitz project. Its written in Blitz3D and can be easily be 
    extended with your own functions. </p>
  <p>BlitzScript3D compiles scripts *.bsc into 'pcode' *.bso. The pcode is then 
    'executed' on a virtual machine. The benefits of this are size and speed. 
    Pcode is (normally) smaller than and executes faster than interpreted code. 
    Although pcode is fast, its roughly executed 4x slower then blitz3D compiled 
    code. For efficient use, this factor should be considered.</p>
  <p>The engine is divided into to parts: Compiler and Virtual Machine.</p>
