033105 - v0.06a
Revised Gui
Added splash image
Added buttons: views, toggle wireframe
Fixed MouseX/Yspeed bug, no more jumping when clicked
Note: Arrg! This took me forever to solve, I noticed that movemouse was the main
cause of improper variable upon capturing when clicked which caused the camera to jump out 
from the center of the viewport. The only way was call another movemouse before hand.
Fixed wireframing mode, now independent on each viewport
